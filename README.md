## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price.
- A regression model using regularisation is to be built, in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- This regression model will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables
- The company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia, which is to be used for the regression analysis



## Conclusions
- The optimal lambda value in case of Ridge is 8 and Lasso is 0.0001
- The Mean Squared error in case of Ridge is 0.122196 and Lasso is 0.121863
- Since Lasso has a lower MSE and also it helps in feature reduction, Lasso has a slight edge over Ridge.
- Based on Lasso, the 10 most significant factors, that generally affect the price are the Zoning classification (RL, RM, FV, RH), Living  area square feet, Overall quality and condition of the house, Foundation type of the house, Garage type attached to the house and Number of cars in the garage.
